# Deezer Scraper
Two scripts available:
1. From a Deezer profile, scraping all linked playlists to .csv
2. Scraping a single playlist to .csv

How to use them:
An ID will be requested at launch, this ID can be found in the URL of the profile/playlist. 
Here's an example : https://www.deezer.com/us/playlist/3184748882 -> ID to input will be 3184748882

Disclaimer:
These scripts were made quickly - no quality or functionnality guaranteed
