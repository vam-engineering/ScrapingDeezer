# Deezer Scraper
Two scripts available:
1. From a Deezer profile, scraping all linked playlists to .csv
2. Scraping a single playlist to .csv

**How to use them:**
An ID will be requested at launch, this ID can be found in the URL of the profile/playlist. 
_Profile example_ : https://www.deezer.com/us/profile/2529 -> ID to input will be 2529
_Playlist example_ : https://www.deezer.com/us/playlist/6399367984 -> ID to input will be 6399367984

**Disclaimer:**
These scripts were made quickly - no quality or functionnality guaranteed

**Note:**
From the extracted .csv files, YouTube playlists can be created using [this other project](https://github.com/vam-engineering/csvToYoutubePlaylists)
